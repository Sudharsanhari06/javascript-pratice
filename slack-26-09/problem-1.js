// Write a program to check if the character is a vowel, print "The character is a vowel." If the character is a consonant, print "The character is a consonant." Make sure to handle both upper and lower case letters. A vowel is a character which is any of letters a, e, i, o, u. Any letter which is a not a vowel is considered a consonant.

let ch='d';
if(ch=='a' || ch=='e'||ch=='i'||ch=='o'||ch=='u'||ch=='A' || ch=='E'||ch=='I'||ch==' o'||ch=='U '){
    console.log("It is a vowel")
}
else{
    console.log("It is a consonant")
}
