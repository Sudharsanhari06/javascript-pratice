// Write a program to check if the character is a vowel, print "The character is a vowel." If the character is a consonant, print "The character is a consonant." Make sure to handle both upper and lower case letters. A vowel is a character which is any of letters a, e, i, o, u. Any letter which is a not a vowel is considered a consonant. 

let char='a';
if(char=='a'||char=='e'||char=='i'||char=='o'||char=='u'||char=='A'||char=='E'||char=='I'||char=='O'||char=='U'){
    console.log("The character is vowel");
}
else{
    console.log("The character consonant");
}
